### Mining-for-Frequent-Community-Structures-Using-Approximate-Graph-Matching
#### This project aims at identifying Frequent Patterns in large graph Datasets.
#### Most of the work in the domain is focused on finding patterns that match exactly. 
#### A novel approach is proposed in this project to help determine the frequent patterns that approximately match with each other. 
#### This approach finds significant applications in the field of deanonymizing social networks, finding approximately matching molecules in protein networks and brain image data.

The algorithms works in three phases as shown below:
