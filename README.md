#### Mining-for-Frequent-Community-Structures-Using-Approximate-Graph-Matching
##### This project aims at identifying Frequent Patterns in large graph Datasets.
##### Most of the work in the domain is focused on finding patterns that match exactly. 
##### A novel approach is proposed in this project to help determine the frequent patterns that approximately match with each other. 
##### This approach finds significant applications in the field of deanonymizing social networks, finding approximately matching molecules in protein networks and brain image data.

> The algorithms works in three phases as shown below:

    Phase 1: Below are the candidates generated for the dataset shown above at different time steps by implementing Random Walks and Markovian Clustering

    Phase 2: Phase 2 aims at filtering out the duplicate communitites and generates unique communities for a given dataset. The result generated by Phase 2 of the algorithm is as shown below:

<img src="https://github.com/PriyaKolliC/Mining-for-Frequent-Community-Structures-Using-Approximate-Graph-Matching/blob/master/Phase2.PNG" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/PriyaKolliC/Mining-for-Frequent-Community-Structures-Using-Approximate-Graph-Matching/blob/master/Phase2.PNG" width="500" height="auto" />

    The signature to each community/cluster in the above table shows the "probability print" of ending up in each node of the cluster given you start at any node. This signature thus helps capture the structure of each cluster and is further used to compare the corresponding communities/subgraphs for matching.


---

    Phase 3: This phase of the algorithm focuses on comparing the communities generated at phase 2 and determining the extent of matching between them.

    Different communities from the graph dataset are matched and the extent of similarity between them is calculated.

Most of the Frequent Subgraph Mining algorithms need us to specify a Support/Threshold value to determine Frequent Subgraphs. <br/>
* *If support = 3, then the subgraphs that occur 3 or more number of times are extracted from the dataset<br/>
* *If support = 4, then the subgraphs that occur 4 or more number of times are extracted from the dataset<br/>

Our approach introduces a unique metric similar to Support in FSM algorithms i.e. Deviation Tolerance.<br/>
* *If allowed deviation = 20%, then the subgraphs that have more number of graphs within 20% of deviation level are extracted from the given dataset.<br/>

The ultimate output of our approach on the above shown dataset is as follows:

<img src="https://github.com/PriyaKolliC/Mining-for-Frequent-Community-Structures-Using-Approximate-Graph-Matching/blob/master/Final.PNG" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/PriyaKolliC/Mining-for-Frequent-Community-Structures-Using-Approximate-Graph-Matching/blob/master/Final.PNG" width="400" height="auto" />

Hence, C5, C6, C4, C7 and C9 are the most frequently occuring approximately matching patterns in the given dataset.
